   you deserve an " i'll put you first " kind of friendship
   A "we can argue but i won't let you sleep without a goodnight" kind of friendship
   A "we will work through it together" kind of friendship
   An "i will never give up on you " kind of friendship.
   A "let's watch your favorite movie" kind of frienship.
   if your friendship is genuine then it should have this words once in a while.

   Friendship is like a butterfly,
   if you run after it 
   it wil flee away
   but if you are calm about it it will fly to you.
   never put yourself in a psoition where 
   you have to fight for attention or love from your friendship
   it is never worth it.
   Friendship is a force that can only work if applied on both ends.

     If you can't trust me then how do you claim to be my friend,
     You must learn people before you welcome them to your inner circle
     some friends are like venom , they will empty your existence with their poison,
     some with their aura will enrich and ignite your soul.
      sometimes when you think this is the long awaited friend
      in a twinkling of an eye it turns out to be wrong and now all the expecations
      all the plans are gone. back to square zero,


      You will never hear articulate words like" i love you"
      maybe its because she is too afraid or maybe its because she doesn't in the words
      Or maybe she thinks you will see through her
