   They say we live to fight another day,
   but the real question is are we really living or dying?
   i am proud of this far i have come,
   but how much further can i go?
   it all begun with my feet being immersed in the waters,
   now my head is below,
   i am much further out than you think,
   and not waving but calling for help   
   all am asking is to be free.

   some days i wake up and 
   i feel everything,
   other days i feel nothing at all.
   Getting out of my home with a mask,
   a mask of happiness,
   for how long should i be strong?
   is there an expiry date?
   i am no longer sure how i wish to drown myself
   because fear is stepping up its game.
   i am a fish drowning in air.

   all this thoughts are clouding my judgemet,
   i want to be happy but the thoughts can't allow,
   the memories of not being able to raise my fees,
   or even just having a weekend off from all work or school staffs,
   or better off having a shoulder to cry on.
   work is not going as well,
   meaning i will have some difficulties sorting out my bills,
   it's not getting any easier and i feel like i am loosing my breathe,
   i feel like i am in a tight container and am suffocating,
   i feel like am loosing the strength to fight,
   ideas are flooding in my mind how to end it all,
   but i live not for myself alone.
