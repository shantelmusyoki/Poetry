    i know you are doing your job but can't you just understand me?
    i am trying so hard to keep up with the rules buuuuuuuuuut...
    i fe
    sometimes i think maybe am cursed
    or maybe i just always do what i feel i should do without thinking of thhe consequences
    
    the government has enforced the curfew rules buuuuuuuut...
    it is at this particular time that i feel like going out and have some fun
    the other days when everything was okay i never saw or felt the need of going outside
    at this time i had books to read and movies to watch 
    is it that i love trouble
    or maybe am just so idle...
    or am i just a trouber maker??
    or does it run in my veins?
    or am i the one making wrong decisions in life
    but again i heard that life is what you make it to be...
