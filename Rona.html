            it all seemed like a joke until a reported death occured,
            we thought it was a prunk call from the government, 
            but things got worse as time went by,
            with more cases being reported each day,
            with new vocubularies added to our daily talks,
            quarantine,lockdown,containment,curfew being the talk of every conversation.
            with only a few people understanding what was really the new reality of life.
            where are we heading to?that is the  question we are all asking ourselves
            should we just give up on this so that we can live to fight tomorrow ?
            but again even that "tomorrow" is not promised

            so many countries are now in total lockdown this shows how serious it is
            even the super power countries are on their knees
            no signs of a solution to this plague 
            but maybe just maybe the solution lies on the most high
            at the end of the day He is the only one who holds our tomorrow
            with each day that dawns being just a miracle 
            
            The wave of fear is evident in everyones eyes,
            from the old to the youngest,
            all of them uncertain of what tomorrow holds,
            with hopelessness taking over their hearts and minds,
            at this time it is everyone for himself God for us all,
            the jokes aint funny no more,
            memes aint helping anymore,
    
            just how should i explain to my kid,
            that tomorrow aint promised anymore?
            how do i calm my old grandma that she aint vulnerable?
            how does an expectant mother welcome her angel to such cruelity?
            how did it even reach to this point?
            where will those with no one to depend on go to?
            the street children,the old,the orphans...
            it is that bad...
              
            All schools are locked down,
            most businesses are not functioning and if they are then they are bringing in less profits 
            no importing or exporting of anything meaning our economy is being affected
            and now we are drowning in debts wondering if we will ever be able to pay it all back
            no one ever predicted this so we didn't see it coming.
            the level at which we were prepared for this pandemic is just close to 0%.

            is it a punishment from the one who bears our tomorrow?
            is it that our soul has disconnected from the highest being?
            is it a fight where the strongest genes get to survive?
            is it fulfillment of the foretold prophecies?
            is it just a wake up call?
            is it time for every country to depend on its own resources with no help from outside?
            is it the end of the world?
            or is it just a conspiracy theory?
    
            fear of the unknown is what is taking over right now...
            maybe just maybe we will start appreciating the little things in life
            living our lives to the fullest each passing second
            repair our connection with the most high...
            and be greatful for every breath we take...
            the next generation is not even guaranteed
            if we see tomorrow then we shall tell the story

            During the first wave of the pandemic everyone was a little bit concerned
            others believing that the virus didn't exist
            and it was just a conspiracy theory from the government to exort more money from them.
            In the second wave people took it seriously and tried to keep safe
            with most people trying to rise up from the dust that the first wave had left them in
            but in the third wave people care less 
            the vaccine is here and most people are looking forward to it
            hoping to reduce the cases of death and infection.
