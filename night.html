    before i could get a grip of sleep yesternight
    all i could think about is,
    what if there had been no you?
    or what if you never had the courage to express your feelings?
    or what if we never met?
    what an empty and boring life it would have been.
    i would never have understood what true love felt like
    neither would i have ever known the true definition of happiness

    when you appeared, you brought me a bliss,
    on that night, we became one
    from the very first kiss
    to the romance,
    gone are the empty nights,
    gone are the unknown emotions
    gone are the unfelt feelings
    now happiness lasts for days,weeks

    i love being intimate being with you
    intimacy for me is giving you my attention,
    even when hundredth folds of people are asking for it
    the intimacy that i talk about is having you at he back of my mind
    no matter how distracted i am,
    this intimacy incudes me being able to call you ,
    late at night to tell you about  my dreams and my fears.

    like a painter without brushes,
    or a poet without words,
    or a flower without fragrance,
    or a life with no freedom
    or a musician with no voice
    that is how i feel without you
    i miss you dearly

    I loved you then,
    I love you now,
    There is no doubt,
    i don't know how but you are now part of my life
    my love for you is true
    You are my life's shining star
    I LOVE YOU JOE MWAURA WARIARA
