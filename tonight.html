    <h1>Tonight!</h1>
    i am messed up tonight,lost in the shadows of my destiny
    with every talk getting harder for me to keep up 
    as i try to hide it all with a beautiful fake fading smile
    but its just you and me tonight and i have to cherish the moment
    cheers to tonight,cheers to what money can't buy(what i feel inside)
    you promised to fix me when shit doesn't go my way
    and this is the night to keep your world.
    all i need tonight is someboby to hold,somebody to heal,
    somebody to know,somebody to have and somebody to love.
    it feels so good to have all that in you
    i love the way you numbed away all the pain 
    and save me when i am my worst enemy
    you are the reason i dont want tonight to bleed into a new day.
    you have showed me the greenlight and i accept to be your moonlight
    This night is cold in the kingdom,i can't wait to cuddle up 
    as we dance to our favourite tune.
    even when you break my heart into two when it heals it beats for you
    took you like a shot thought that i could chase you with a cold evening
    but now what my heart beats for is you
    and i have tried to convince myself i don't want you even though i do
    you are stack in my head and i can't get you out of here
    i want to hold you even when i am not supposed to
    sware for a while i stare at my phone just to see your name
    send me your location and lets focus on communication
    love me you do,touch me like you do
    i was told to take caution when it comes to love but with you caution is underrated
    lets talk about all the thinga we shouldn't talk about
    from the first touch you found a weak spot
    i am the remedy mixed with the energy
    i trust your heart i trust in you when times are hard i reach for you
    i will never forget you i wil never pretend to 
    you have always been so true since you came through
    
    i am getting used to being someone you love
    i will evey mountain and swim the endless sea
    this night is cold in the kingdom and i can't wait to cuddle up
    let it not dawn 
    what a beautiful life
