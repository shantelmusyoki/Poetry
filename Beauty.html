they say beauty lies on the eyes of the beholder
guard your beauty like someone is trying to break in and steal it
for a woman life is a battle 
and beauty is their machine gun
if they can see where your makeup ends and your face begin
you have done it wrong 
makeup is a face not a mask you have to blend 
indifference is the best revenge
beauty that matters is the one from the inside 
woman ill prepared is set up for failure
if you let tour gut down everyone can get in
